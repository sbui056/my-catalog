# 🏋️‍♀️ WorkoutToday: A Personal Exercise Catalog

**WorkoutToday** is a fully interactive, filterable, and searchable catalog of exercises designed to help users build their workout of the day. This passion project was created for the Snap Engineering Academy application challenge to showcase web development and data structure fundamentals.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
Build a catalog website centered around a personal passion — in this case, fitness and weightlifting. The site leverages arrays and objects in JavaScript to organize and display a wide range of exercise data with an intuitive UI.
